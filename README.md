# Twitter API Tutorial
In this tutorial there will be a detailed explaination of how to use the Twitter API. <br> This work is going to use __Python__ as programming language.<br><br>
## What is Twitter?
Twitter is a 'microblogging' social network that allows you to send and receive short posts called tweets. Tweets can be up to 140 characters long and can include links to relevant websites and resources.<br>

Twitter users follow other users. If you follow someone you can see their tweets in your twitter 'timeline'. You can choose to follow people and organisations with similar academic and personal interests to you.<br>

You can create your own tweets or you can retweet information that has been tweeted by others. Retweeting means that information can be shared quickly and efficiently with a large number of people [1]. <br>

During the last years, Twitter became very important and its popolarity is increasing day by day. It is literally used by everybody, from artists to politicians, for many reasons, such as:<br>
* express an idea and tell thoughts about something
* promote a product or a service
* reach a big amount of people
* explore the audience and try to reach new people
* share th work and get feedbacks from people<br>

### How to use Twitter
* To use the social media and its features users have to log in. If they don't have any Twitter account, it is possible to sign in and create a new account.
* After the log in, users can use all twitter features, such as creating new tweet, retweet an existing tweet, search for specific tweets, and so on.<br><br>

## Twitter Developer Platform
Twitter, as well as many social networks, provides to users __API (Application Programming Interfaces)__.
### API
APIs are tools used to facilitate the interaction between developers and platforms. They are useful when developers would like to use some elements of this social network with ease, to make the work faster. There are many types of API which are able to extend and improve the functions of a software. This tool, moreover, allows the interaction between programmes and software, with the possibility to create more professional features.<br>

How can APIs be used? How can a software interract with APIs? The relationship created between APIs and a software is similar to what happens in the Web server-Client paradigm: to request a service or data, the client generally sends a message to a server, which respondes with the desired result. The same thing happens between APIs and softwares. The request is made to an __endpoint__, which provides a specific response. Clearly, the sofware has to be authentificated to access to the server data.<br>

To make these requests, __REST__ (Representational State Transfer) is used. It is the way to made the requests between softwares and APIs. REST uses some protocols such as HTTP. For instance, if a sofware needs to use an API, HTTP is used to define the structure of the request and the response. In this scenario, the server (API) respondes to the sofware not with a HTML page, but with structured data in a specific format, such as Json.
### Twitter API
Twitter API allow its service to be accessed via APIs to enable software development that integrates with Twitter, such as a solution that helps a company respond to customer feedback on Twitter. They also allow users to deal with Tweets is a easier way. <br>

Usually, Twitter API are used to:
* Access Twitter profiles and posts
* Publish tweets and retweet existing tweets
* Analyze tweets and make evaluations<br>

### How to access to Twitter API
Starting to use Twitter API requires some steps:
* Firstly, go to the Developer Platform [page](https://developer.twitter.com/en) and click on sign in (top right)<br>

* After clicking on sign in, create a Twitter account if there is not one available, then click access<br>
