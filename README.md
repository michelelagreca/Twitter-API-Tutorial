# Twitter API Tutorial
In this tutorial there will be a detailed explaination of how to use the Twitter API. <br> This work is going to use __Python__ as programming language.<br><br>
## What is Twitter?
Twitter is a 'microblogging' social network that allows you to send and receive short posts called tweets. Tweets can be up to 140 characters long and can include links to relevant websites and resources.<br>

Twitter users follow other users. If you follow someone you can see their tweets in your twitter 'timeline'. You can choose to follow people and organisations with similar academic and personal interests to you.<br>

You can create your own tweets or you can retweet information that has been tweeted by others. Retweeting means that information can be shared quickly and efficiently with a large number of people [1]. <br>

During the last years, Twitter became very important and its popolarity is increasing day by day. It is literally used by everybody, from artists to politicians, for many reasons, such as:<br>
* express an idea and tell thoughts about something
* promote a product or a service
* reach a big amount of people
* explore the audience and try to reach new people
* share th work and get feedbacks from people<br>
#### How to use Twitter
* To use the social media and its features users have to log in. If they don't have any Twitter account, it is possible to sign in and create a new account.
* After the log in, users can use all twitter features, such as creating new tweet, retweet an existing tweet, search for specific tweets, and so on.<br><br>
