# Twitter API Tutorial
In this tutorial there will be a detailed explaination of how to use the Twitter API. <br> This work is going to use __Python__ as programming language.
## What is Twitter?
Twitter is a 'microblogging' system that allows you to send and receive short posts called tweets. Tweets can be up to 140 characters long and can include links to relevant websites and resources.<br>

Twitter users follow other users. If you follow someone you can see their tweets in your twitter 'timeline'. You can choose to follow people and organisations with similar academic and personal interests to you.<br>

You can create your own tweets or you can retweet information that has been tweeted by others. Retweeting means that information can be shared quickly and efficiently with a large number of people [1]. <br>
